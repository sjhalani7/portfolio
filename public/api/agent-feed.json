      "Hi, I’m Shiv Jhalani — a backend-focused software engineer at INRIX with a strong interest in data, product engineering, and modern AI-driven systems.",
      "I’m motivated by curiosity and learn best by building: from experimenting with embeddings and search, to prototyping agentic AI systems, to shipping data-heavy features and services in production. I enjoy working with new ideas, new tools, and new technologies, and turning them into real, working products.",
      "I use modern AI tools as part of my workflow — not as a shortcut, but as leverage. I care about shipping faster, iterating intelligently, and then applying strong fundamentals to make the result correct, reliable, and maintainable.",
      "What keeps me motivated is how quickly this field evolves. I have a constant need to keep up — new tools, new approaches, new ideas — and I enjoy turning that motion into real projects that solve real problems. I’m always building, always learning, and always looking for the next interesting problem to dive into."
